![CFood](https://github.com/Geertvdc/Xamarin-NotHotdog/raw/master/NotHotdog/NotHotdog/NotHotdog.Android/Resources/drawable-hdpi/icon.png)

This app is a spinn off from the app shown in the HBO TV Series "Sillicon Valley" called "See Food" made by Jian-Yang. The app is made to show how easy it is to create an app that really works using Azure Cognitive services and Xamarin. The app works on iOS and Android (and probably windows UWP, havent tested that) and shares 100% of the code while delivering native app experience.
